# Question Generator

This project uses ChatGPT API to generate questions about any topic in programming.
It gives you a prompt in your terminal with a question and four alternatives, you can choose any alternative and it tells you if got it right or wrong. It also keeps your score!

`note:` You need an OpenAi API Key to use this prompt. For more information on creating an API Key, please refer to the [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/api-keys).
